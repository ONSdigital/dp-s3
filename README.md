Client to interact with AWS S3

### Getting started

#### Setting up AWS credentials

In order to access AWS S3, this library will require your acess key id and access secret key. You can either setup a default profile in ~/.aws/credentials file:
```
[default]
aws_access_key_id=<id>
aws_secret_access_key=<secret>
region=eu-west-1
```

Or export the values as environmental variables:
```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<id>
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<secret>
```

More information in [Amazon documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide//cli-chap-configure.html)


#### Usage

You can access AWS S3 creating a new client using the New() function in client.go providing the right region. Please, note that you will only be able to see S3 buckets created in a particular region using a client acccessing that region.

```
s3cli := s3client.New(<region>)
s3cli.Get(<url>)
```

### Health package

The S3 checker function currently accepts a bucket name, and tries to get it. The health check will succeed only if the bucket can be accessed using the clinet (i.e. client must be authenticated correctly, bucket must exist and have been created in the same region as the client).

Read the [Health Check Specification](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp/blob/master/standards/HEALTH_CHECK_SPECIFICATION.md) for details.

After creating an S3 client as described above, call s3 health checker with `s3cli.Checker(context.Background())` and this will return a check object:

```
{
    "name": "string",
    "status": "string",
    "message": "string",
    "status_code": "int",
    "last_checked": "ISO8601 - UTC date time",
    "last_success": "ISO8601 - UTC date time",
    "last_failure": "ISO8601 - UTC date time"
}
```
